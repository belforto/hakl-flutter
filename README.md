<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹,this is HAKL app for basketball players</h1>
<h3 align="center">An app where you can find players to play against on your local basketball court in your city.</h3>
  <br/>
<p align="center"> 
  Unlike other sports, basketball can be played on one hoop, 1vs1, 3x3, 5x5 however the guys decide
  <br/>
  </p>
<br/>
<h3 align="center">How?</h3>
<br/>
<br/>
<p align="left"> 
  You open the app, and the map of the courts in your local city and map will show up
  <br/>
  On the map there are basketball courts. You can can scroll this map and check courts you are interested in.
    <br/>
  You want to play?  Check out the court if someone had checked-in so you can go there and join those guys on the court.
  <br/>
  No one is there, on the court?
  No problem, you can <strong>check-in</strong> and share with app users you are at the court ready...Be sure someone will come quickly to test your skills under the hoops.
